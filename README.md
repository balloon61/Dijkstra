# Dijkstra
Dijkstra Path Planning

Require Lib:cv2, numpy, queue, heapq, scipy.signal, 
cd to LOCATION which include the file
python3 main.py

Enter the initial pose
(x, y)
for example:
10 20
If the point is at the obstacle's pose, or too close to the obstacle (clearance 5 mm)
then you will need to enter again.
After successfuly enter the initial pose, do the same thing in goal pose.

The code will find the whether it has a solution first, if it has one, then visuallize the process.
