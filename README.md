# Dijkstra
Dijkstra Path Planning

#Require Lib:cv2, numpy, queue, heapq, scipy.signal, 
#cd to LOCATION which include the file
#python3 Dijkstra-pathplanning-polun-chen.py

#Enter the initial pose
(x, y)
for example:
10 20

If the point is at the obstacle's pose, or too close to the obstacle (clearance 5 mm)
then you will need to enter again.
After successfuly enter the initial pose, do the same thing in goal pose.

The code will find the whether it has a solution first, if it has one, then visuallize the process.
